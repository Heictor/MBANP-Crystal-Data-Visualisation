## Python based tool built for analysis and efficient visualisation of MBANP crystal data.

### This software was built by GM²SC to extract, organize and present the data from organic crytal analysis, on a efficient and easy manner to comprehend, without compromise or lose information.

MBANP, abbreviation for 2-(α-methylbenzylamino)-5-nitropyridine, or also known by C13H13N302, is a organic crystal with 
high energetic potential.
This potential exists thanks to some properties of this material, such as the Second-harmonic generation (SHG). The SHG
is a process of the nonlinear optical that happens when two photons with the same frequency generate a new photon with
twice the energy of the initial ones. This joint happens when the initial photons interact with a material witch presents
nonlinear optical features. As consequence, we have the double of the frequency and half of the wavelength as result of the
following equation.

As we can notice, frequency and wavelength are inversely proportional greatnesses.

This is a 2D planification of a tridimensional graph.
When this application is ran, the 3D graph can be rotated in all axis if interactive option is enabled.
